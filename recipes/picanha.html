    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Picanha is a very tasty brazilian cut of meat, juicy and soft</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cloves garlic cloves, crushed, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound beef top sirloin, trimmed of excess fat</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Preparation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix crushed garlic and salt together in a bowl until combined into a paste.</li>
      <li><p>Rub garlic paste onto meat until covered. Place into a bowl; cover with lemon juice.</p>
          <p>Marinate until the meat has absorbed desired flavor, 30 minutes to 4 hours.</p>
          <p>Remove meat from the lemon juice. Baste with olive oil.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li><p>Cook meat on the preheated grill, turning frequently until the outer edges are charred and center is uncooked, about 5 minutes.</p>
          <p>Remove from heat; slice off charred edges, cutting against the grain.</p>
          <p>Return the uncooked center portion of the meat back to the grill.</p>
          <p>Cook until the meat begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side.</p>
          <p>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</p>
